# Decouple Frontend/Backend with Prefect Cloud Integration

## Architecture Overview

Transform the monolithic Streamlit app into a distributed architecture:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit UI (file upload, job status, results download)
- **Backend**: FastAPI REST API (job submission, status polling, result retrieval)
- **Orchestration**: Prefect Cloud (serverless GPU workers for DSPy processing)
- **Event Trigger**: Azure Blob Storage → Event Grid → Prefect webhook
- **Testing**: Docker Compose (frontend + backend, real Prefect Cloud connection)

## Phase 1: Create New Branch & Project Structure

Create a feature branch and reorganize the project for multi-service architecture:

```
app/
├── frontend/              # Streamlit app (new)
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── app.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── backend/               # FastAPI service (new)
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── main.py       # FastAPI app
│   │   ├── routes.py     # Endpoints
│   │   └── models.py     # Pydantic schemas
│   ├── prefect_flows/    # Prefect flow definitions
│   │   ├── extraction_flow.py
│   │   └── tasks.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── docker-compose.yml     # Local testing
└── shared/                # Common code
    └── config.py          # Shared settings
```

**Files to create:**

- `docker-compose.yml` - orchestrate frontend + backend
- `frontend/app.py` - new Streamlit UI with API calls
- `backend/api/main.py` - FastAPI application
- `backend/prefect_flows/extraction_flow.py` - migrate main.py logic to Prefect flow

## Phase 2: Build FastAPI Backend

Create a lightweight REST API to handle job lifecycle:

**Key endpoints:**

- `POST /jobs/submit` - Accept file uploads, store in Azure Blob, trigger Prefect flow
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/status` - Poll job execution status
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/results` - Retrieve SAS URL for completed matrix
- `GET /health` - Health check

**Integration points:**

- Use `prefect.deployments.run_deployment()` to trigger flows
- Store job metadata in-memory (dict) or lightweight DB (SQLite for MVP)
- Return Prefect flow run ID to frontend for polling

**Key files:**

- `backend/api/main.py` - FastAPI app with CORS, routes, startup logic
- `backend/api/routes.py` - Endpoint implementations
- `backend/api/models.py` - Request/response schemas (JobSubmission, JobStatus, JobResult)

## Phase 3: Convert Processing Logic to Prefect Flow

Transform `main.py` processing pipeline into a Prefect flow with serverless execution:

**Flow structure:**

```python
@flow(name="extract-compliance-requirements")
def extraction_flow(job_id: str, blob_urls: List[str], opportunity_id: str):
    # Download files from Azure Blob
    files = download_files_task(blob_urls)
    
    # Run DSPy pipeline (GPU-intensive)
    requirements = run_dspy_pipeline_task(opportunity_id, files)
    
    # Generate outputs and upload
    sas_url = generate_and_upload_task(requirements, job_id)
    
    return {"job_id": job_id, "sas_url": sas_url, "count": len(requirements)}
```

**Tasks to create:**

- `download_files_task` - Fetch files from Azure Blob
- `run_dspy_pipeline_task` - Wrap existing `run_dspy_pipeline()` logic
- `generate_and_upload_task` - Create Excel/JSON/CSV and upload

**Key files:**

- `backend/prefect_flows/extraction_flow.py` - Main flow definition
- `backend/prefect_flows/tasks.py` - Individual task functions
- Keep existing `src/` modules intact, import them in tasks

## Phase 4: Modernize Streamlit Frontend

Rebuild the UI with improved visual design and API communication:

**UI Enhancements:**

- Modern card-based layout with `st.container()` and custom CSS
- Real-time progress indicators with `st.progress()` and status updates
- Better color scheme and typography
- Animated loading states during processing
- Job history table (recent submissions)

**API Integration:**

- Replace direct `process_opportunity()` calls with `requests.post()` to backend API
- Implement polling loop for job status (check every 5s)
- Display real-time status: "Queued" → "Running" → "Completed" / "Failed"
- Show estimated time remaining based on file size

**Key changes to `frontend/app.py`:**

- Extract file upload logic (keep existing HigherGov + manual upload)
- Add `submit_job()` function that calls FastAPI backend
- Add `poll_job_status()` with progress bar
- Add results display with SAS URL download button

## Phase 5: Docker Compose Configuration

Create local testing environment with frontend + backend services:

**`docker-compose.yml` structure:**

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - PREFECT_API_URL=${PREFECT_API_URL}
      - PREFECT_API_KEY=${PREFECT_API_KEY}
      - AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=${AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}
      # ... other env vars
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
  
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "8501:8501"
    environment:
      - BACKEND_API_URL=http://backend:8000
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

**Testing approach:**

- Use real Prefect Cloud connection (with dev workspace)
- Test with small sample files (< 5 pages)
- Verify end-to-end flow: upload → API call → Prefect execution → result retrieval

## Phase 6: Azure Event Grid Integration (Optional Enhancement)

Set up event-driven triggers for automatic processing:

**Architecture:**

1. User uploads file to Azure Blob Storage container
2. Blob Storage emits event to Event Grid
3. Event Grid calls Prefect webhook
4. Prefect Cloud triggers flow automatically

**Implementation steps:**

- Create Event Grid subscription on Azure Storage Account
- Configure Prefect webhook as Event Grid endpoint
- Add blob metadata (job_id, opportunity_id) for event payload
- Update frontend to show "auto-processing" status

**Note:** This is a production enhancement; start with manual API triggers for MVP.

## Phase 7: Deployment Preparation

Prepare for Azure Container Apps deployment:

**Backend deployment:**

- Containerize FastAPI app (already has Dockerfile)
- Configure environment variables in Azure
- Set up Prefect Cloud work pool (serverless with GPU)
- Deploy to Azure Container Apps (minimal resources)

**Frontend deployment:**

- Containerize Streamlit app (already has Dockerfile)
- Point `BACKEND_API_URL` to backend service URL
- Deploy to Azure Container Apps (minimal resources)
- Configure custom domain (optional)

**Prefect deployment:**

- Create Prefect deployment for `extraction_flow`
- Configure work pool: Prefect Serverless (75 free GPU hours)
- Set concurrency limits and retry policies
- Test with production API keys

## Testing Strategy

**Local testing (Docker Compose):**

1. Start services: `docker-compose up`
2. Upload test file via Streamlit UI
3. Verify API receives request and triggers Prefect flow
4. Monitor Prefect Cloud UI for flow execution
5. Check frontend displays results correctly

**Integration testing:**

- Test with PDF, Word, Excel files
- Test HigherGov integration flow
- Test error handling (invalid files, API failures)
- Verify SAS URL generation and download

**Performance testing:**

- Test with large files (50+ pages)
- Monitor Prefect execution time
- Check Azure Blob upload/download speeds

## Migration Notes

**Preserving existing functionality:**

- Keep all `src/` modules unchanged (extraction, integrations, IO)
- Reuse existing `src/config.py` for settings
- Maintain Azure Blob Storage for outputs
- Keep HigherGov integration intact

**Breaking changes:**

- Streamlit app no longer calls `main.py` directly
- Processing is now asynchronous (requires polling)
- Job IDs required for tracking status

**Rollback plan:**

- Keep `app/app.py` and `app/main.py` intact on main branch
- Feature branch allows safe testing without affecting production
- Can merge incrementally (backend first, then frontend)
